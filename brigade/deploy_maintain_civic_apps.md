## I want to help deploy and maintain civic apps
As a Brigade member I want to help connect more localities to apps that make positive contributions to civic life.

When I see an App Deployment that I am able support then I want to [Join](join_app_deployment.md) the App Deployment.
* So that I can join the group deploying and maintaining the App

When I do not see an App Deployment that I am able support then I want to Start [Start](start_app_deployment.md) an App Deployment.
* So that I can have a place to track and coordinate the App Deployment
* So that I can tell people about the App Deployment

When I'm working on an open data App Deployment I want to register my activity with the Brigade platform.
* So that people know I am active.
* So that I can record my activity and view my history.

When I commit changes to an App Deployment I want to report the action to the Brigade platform.
* So that I can have a place to track the App Deployment
* So that I can tell people about the App Deployment
