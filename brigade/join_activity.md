#  I want to Join an Activity
When I see an Activity that I am able support then I want to Join the Activity.
* So that I can join the group working on the Activity
* So that I can participate in group discussions about the Activity
* So that I can see and/or receive updates when there is an event or activity for the Activity

## Notify
When I Join an Activity I want to Notify the network.

So that others will receive a link to my Profile and to the Activity...

* ...when I send a Member Joined Activity email to brigade@codeforamerica.org
  * ...and watchers of the Activity
  * ...and people near me
* ...when I send a Member Joined Activity tweet using the [#cfabrigade](https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23cfabrigade) hashtag
