#  I want to open civic data
As a Brigade member I want to contribute to the growing body of linked, open data about civic life.

When I see an open data initiative that I am able support then I want to ([Join](join_initiative.md)) that initiative.
* So that I can join the group working on that initiative

When I do not see an open data initiative that I am able support then I want to Start ([Start](start_initiative.md)) an initiative.
* So that I can have a place to track and coordinate the initiative
* So that I can tell people about the initiative

When I'm working on an open data initiative I want to register my activity with the Brigade platform.
* So that people know I am active.
* So that I can record my activity and view my history.

When I commit changes to an open data catalog or repository I want to report the action to the Brigade platform.
* So that I can have a place to track activity on the initiative
* So that I can tell people about activity on this initiative
