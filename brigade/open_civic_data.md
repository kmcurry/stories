#  I want to open civic data
As a Brigade member I want to contribute to the growing body of linked, open data about civic life.

When I see an open data Activity that I am able support then I want to [Join](join_activity.md) that Activity.
* So that I can join the group working on that Activity

When I do not see an open data Activity that I am able support then I want to Start [Start](start_activity.md) an Activity.
* So that I can have a place to track and coordinate the Activity
* So that I can tell people about the Activity

When I'm working on an open data Activity I want to register my activity with the Brigade platform.
* So that people know I am active.
* So that I can record my activity and view my history.

When I commit changes to an open data catalog or repository I want to report the action to the Brigade platform.
* So that I can have a place to track the Activity
* So that I can tell people about the Activity
