## I want to organize a Brigade
As a Brigade Member I want to lead a Brigade where I live.

When I see that there is no [Activity](activity.md) or [Deployed App](deployed_app.md) where I live I want to [Start](start_activity.md) an Activity or [Start](start_app_deployment.md) an App Deployment

* So that I can open data, work on open government initiatives, and deploy civic apps where I live
* So that others will see that an [Activity](activity.md) or [Deployed App](deployed_app.md) initiative has started
