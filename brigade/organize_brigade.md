## I want to organize a Brigade
As a Brigade Member I want to lead a Brigade where I live.

When I see that there is no [Activity](activity.md) or [Deployed App](deployed_app.md) where I live I want to [Start](start_activity.md) an Activity or [Start](start_app_deployment.md) an app deployment

* So that I have a place to organize and track activities and app deployments
* So that there will be an online forum where local activities and app deployments can be discussed
* So that others will see that an [Activity](activity.md) or [Deployed App](deployed_app.md) initiative has started
