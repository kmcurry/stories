#  I want to Start an Activity
When I do not see an Activity that I am able support then I want to Start an Activity.
* So that that others can [Join](join_initiative.md) and help me work on the Activity
* So that there will be a group forum and other channels for discussions about the Activity
* So that I can publish and syndicate updates when there is an event or activity for the Activity

The Activity should come from a list of Activitys, for example: Cataloging Data, Publishing Data, Drafting Policy, Drafting Legislation, Drafting Rules, and others

## Notify
When I Start an Activity I want to Notify the network.

So that others will receive a link to the Activity...

* ...when I send a New Activity email to brigade@codeforamerica.org
  * ...and watchers of the Activity
  * ...and people near me
* ...when I send a New Activity tweet using the [#cfabrigade](https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23cfabrigade) hashtag
