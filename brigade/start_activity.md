#  I want to Start an [Activity](activity.md)
When I do not see an [Activity](activity.md) that I am able support then I want to Start an [Activity](activity.md).
* So that that others can [Join](join_initiative.md) and help me work on the [Activity](activity.md)
* So that there will be a group forum and other channels for discussions about the [Activity](activity.md)
* So that I can publish and syndicate updates when there is an event or [Activity](activity.md) for the [Activity](activity.md)

## Notify
When I Start an [Activity](activity.md) I want to Notify the network.

So that others will receive a link to the [Activity](activity.md)...

* ...when a New [Activity](activity.md) email is sent to brigade@codeforamerica.org
  * ...and watchers of the [Activity](activity.md)
  * ...and people near me
* ...when a New [Activity](activity.md) tweet is sent using the [#cfabrigade](https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23cfabrigade) hashtag
