# I want to support an open government initiative
As a Brigade member I want help draft, submit, sponsor and otherwise support structural and procedural changes in government that make it more open.

When I see an open government initiative that I am able support then I want to [Join](join_activity.md) that initiative.
* So that I can join the group working on that initiative

When I do not see an open government initiative that I am able support then I want to [Start](start_activity.md) an initiative.
* So that I can have a place to track and coordinate the initiative
* So that I can tell people about the initiative

When I'm working on an open government initiative I want to register my activity with the Brigade platform.
* So that people know I am active.
* So that I can record my activity and view my history.

When I commit changes to an open government document I want to report the action to the Brigade platform.
* So that I can have a place to track activity on the initiative
* So that I can tell people about activity on this initiative
